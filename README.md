v0.1 Sunday, 10 March 2013

## Requirements

* Ruby
* OfflineIMAP to be installed  
  Install it using aptitude, port, homebrew, or whatever

## Installation

Copy *config-example.rb* to *config.rb* 
and change dump_config[:host] to your domain.

## Usage

@./dump.rb username theirPassword@

Dumping a user's entire mailbox takes a long time, especially if they 
have a lot of messages in there. Make yourself several coffees. Read 
a book. Read a book. Read a mighty fine book.

Once done, you will have the user's entire email archive, both sent 
and received, in the folder named for their username. It will take 
up a lot of disk space, so find something to do with it.
